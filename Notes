There are three basic components to the monitoring system:

1) A mechanism to gather SLURM and process data and index it:
/mnt/xfs1/home/carriero/projects/slurm/utils/current

A polling loop to gather data kicked off by
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 carriero carriero  1434 Mar 22 11:47 StartSlurmMonitoring
which invokes
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 carriero carriero  3532 Dec 19 10:16 slurmMon.py
which invokes concurrent scans for processes on individual nodes using
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 carriero carriero   528 Aug  5 12:37 ps.py


A polling loop to index gathered data and divide it into node-specific pieces,
also kicked off by
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 carriero carriero  1434 Mar 22 11:47 StartSlurmMonitoring
which invokes
  -rw-r--r-- 1 carriero carriero  4950 Aug 20 21:51 indexAndSplitMonData.py
When complete, it uses an HTTP post request to send a summary to the web interface.

2) A mechanism to gather file system data and index it:

/mnt/xfs1/home/carriero/projects/fileCensus

A polling loop
  -rwxr-xr-x   1 carriero carriero   677 Nov  7 10:33 sumFromManifest.sh
which invokes
  -rw-r--r--   1 carriero carriero  1281 Nov  7 10:25 sumFromManifest.py
to process a manifest generated by Andras's backup system

3) A web interface:
/mnt/xfs1/home/carriero/projects/slurm/utils/current

Cherrpy web server
  -rw-r--r-- 1 carriero carriero  9401 Dec 19 10:19 smcpgraph.py
 
Module to process file system info into a form suitable for highcharts
  -rw-r--r-- 1 carriero carriero  1505 Nov  7 10:56 fs2hc.py

Module to process SLURM/process info into a form suitable for highcharts
  -rw-r--r-- 1 carriero carriero  2477 Nov  1 21:58 scanSMSplitHighcharts.py


Ugly bits: messy structure reflecting growth over time and mission creep.

What needs doing (aside from addressing ugliness): scale (both
background processing and visuals) for larger cluster, multiple SLURM
data sources, multiple file system data sources.
